Data Preprocessing 

    Data Preprocessing is a processing is a process to covert raw data into meaningul data using 
    different techiques.

Why is data Preprocessing Important ?
-----------------------------------

-> Data in the real world is dirty          ->Data Quality Elements
    -> Incomplete                              -> Accurecy
    -> Noisy                                   -> Competeness
    -> Inconsistent                            -> Cosistency
    -> Duplicate                               -> Believability
                                               -> Interpretability

Machine Learning algorithm follow the rule(learn like Kids)
    ->GIGO = Garbage in Garbage Out

Step/Technique in Data Preprocessing
-----------------------------------
-> Major steps in data Preprocessing
    -> Data cleaning
    -> Data Integration
    -> Data Reduction
    -> Data Transformation
    -> Data Discretization


    What is data cleaning ?
    -----------------------
    Data cleaning means filling in missing value ,smooth out noise while identifying outliers ,
    correct inconsistencies in the data 

    What is data Integration ?
    ------------------------ 
    Data integration is a Technique to merges data from multiple sources into a coherent data store,
    such as a data warehouse.

    What is data Reduction ?
    ----------------------
    Data Reduction is a Technique use to reduce the data size by aggegation ,eliminating fetures,
    or clustrering for instance.

    What is data transformation ?
    ---------------------------
    Data Trannsformation means data are tranformed or consolidate into forms appropriate for ML model
    training ,such as normalization ,may be applied where data are scaled to fall within a smaller range
    like 0.0 to 1.0 .
        -> Aggregation
        -> Feature type convertion
        -> normalization
        -> Attribute/ Feature construction

    What is Data Discretization ?
    ---------------------------
    ->Data Discretization Technique transforms numeric data by mapping values to interval or concept 
      lables.
    -> It can be used to reduce the number of values for a given continous attribute by the attribute
      by dividing the range of the attribute into intervals.
    -> Discretization techniques include 
        ->Binning
        ->Histogram analysis
        ->cluster analysis
        ->Decision-tree analysis
        ->Correlation analysis
